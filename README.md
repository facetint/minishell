## Shell Introduction

âœ£ In a shell, the user can run programs and also direct input from a file and output from a file.
    Bash allows users to enter commands and give instructions to the operating system.

## What Is Bash and How Does It Work?

  ## Prompt Display :

  Bash displays a "prompt" for the user to enter a command. Typically, this prompt contains the user name, computer name and working directory. The user can enter commands under this prompt.

  ## Command Input :

  The user can enter commands under prompt. These commands are used to perform system-related operations (file management, program execution, network operations, etc.)

  ## Command Interpreter :

  Bash interprets commands entered by the user. This means checking if the command is a defined program, processing the parameters if necessary and executing the command.

  ## Command Execution :

  It passes the interpreted command to the operating system through system calls and the operating system executes the command. For example, the ls command, a file listing command, requests the operating system to list files.

  ## Output and Error Checking : 

  After the command is executed, Bash checks whether the command completed successfully. If an error occurred, it displays error messages. It also reports the exit status of the command (0 if successful, or a different value if failed).

  ## History and Retrieval :

  It keeps a history of commands entered by the user and allows the user to access this history and undo previous commands. This is achieved with the arrow keys or the history command.

  ## Shell Scripts :

  Bash also allows users to create shell scripts that contain a sequence of commands. These scripts are used to automate specific tasks by stringing together sequential commands.

These basic steps of Bash provide a user-friendly command-line environment and come with a wide range of commands. Users can customize Bash and there is extensive documentation and community support.
